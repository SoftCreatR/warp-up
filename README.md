## About

[WARP+](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-warp-plus/) uses Cloudflare's virtual private backbone, known as Argo, to achieve higher speeds and ensure your connection is encrypted across the long haul of the Internet.

Warp-Up is a tool, that uses the referral system of WARP+ to add a nearly unlimited amount of extra traffic to your existing WARP account.

## Usage

Before you can start using this tool, you need a WARP ID. To obtain it, [download and install the 1.1.1.1 app](https://warp.plus/Uxs4a) on your mobile device first, if not already done.

As soon as the app has been installed, open it and tap on the â˜° Icon. Tap Advanced -> Diagnostics and copy your ID from the client configuration.

### One-Step Execution (Linux / WSL)

```bash
bash <(curl -sL dist.1-2.dev/warp-up)
```

**or (Windows / Powershell)**

```powershell
PowerShell -Command "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope Process; iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SoftCreatR/warp-up/main/install-warp-up.ps1 | iex && bash warp-up.sh"
```

### Alternative Method

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoftCreatR/warp-up
cd warp-up
bash warp-up.sh
```

### Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoftCreatR/warp-up
cd warp-up/docker
```

Edit the file `docker-compose.yml` and configure Warp-Up. See [warp-up.conf.dist](https://github.com/SoftCreatR/warp-up/blob/main/warp-up.conf.dist) for an example configuration.

When done, run: 

```bash
sudo docker build --tag warp-up:latest .
sudo docker run -it warp-up
```

#### Options available

Currently available build options are

* `--id` : Your Warp ID
* `--iterations` : Number of iterations / Amount of GB you want to receive
* `--interval` : Seconds between every request
* `--log-file` : Log everything to the file provided

**Default options** :

* Interval: 20 seconds
* Log File: `warp-up.log`

**Configuration File** :

Instead of executing Warp-Up parameterized or through the wizard, you can create a file `warp-up.conf`, including your default configuration. Available options are:

* REFERRER
* ITERATIONS
* INTERVAL
* DISCLAIMER_AGREE
* LOG_FILE

See [warp-up.conf.dist](https://github.com/SoftCreatR/warp-up/blob/main/warp-up.conf.dist) for an example configuration.

After creating your configuration, simply run `bash warp-up` without parameters, and you are good to go. However, all configuration options can be overridden by executing Warp-Up parameterized, as usual.

#### Additional notes

* You may want to execute Warp-Up on your dedicated server or VPS. Please note, that many IP addresses and ranges are blocked by Cloudflare (e.g. Hetzner) thus they're unable to connect to the cloudflareclient.com API. Instead, you should run Warp-Up on your local machine.

* API requests are limited and may result in error responses. In this case, make sure, that you increase the interval option when running Warp-Up or omit the `--interval` argument to use the default value of 20 seconds.

* You can bypass the disclaimer on startup by executing Warp-Up with the `--disclaimer` argument.

* You may want to run Warp-Up until you stop it manually instead of stopping after N iterations. In this case, execute Warp-Up with `--iterations 0`.
